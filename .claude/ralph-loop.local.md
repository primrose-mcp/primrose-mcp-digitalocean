Build the digitalocean MCP server following digitalocean-mcp-task.md in this directory. The template is in primrose-mcp-template/. IMPORTANT: The task file contains example endpoints only - you must research the full API at https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/api-reference/ to identify and implement ALL available endpoints, not just the examples provided.
